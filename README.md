# Tree-Project

## Overview

This project is a binary search tree (**BST**) implementation and visualization tool written in C++. It allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize binary search trees directly in the terminal.

## Features

- Insert and delete nodes in the BST
- Search for nodes in the BST
- Visualize the BST structure in the terminal

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- CMake (for build configuration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MaximeAlgosup/Random-Tree-Project
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Random-Tree-Project
    ```
3. Build the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build
    cd build
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the binary search tree program, use the following command:
```sh
./randomTreeProject
```
<!-- TODO: change the executable name with the real project name -->

This will start the program and allow you to interact with the binary search tree directly in the terminal.
